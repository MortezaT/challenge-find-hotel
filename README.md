You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Documentation

> here you can document your decisions. ✍️

### Libraries
`formik` for managing form
`react-jss` I used `Matrial-UI` in many project and prefer it however I wasn't if it's alright to use a UI library so I decided to go easy and only use `JSS`

### State management
I'm familiar with redux however since I in the past year I used `Apollo Client` for `GraphQL` in my projects - as a requirement of interaction with backend which cahces the server responses and allows client state management as well - so I rather not to use `Redux` or other state managements and for simple states and actions I use react context or reducer hook. Here since all form states are managed with `formik` so the rest can be handled with state and memoizing hooks

### Progress
Just like any other project [start perfect and getting worse as getting closer to the deadline](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/e5796c9594880cbe387cdebc82277925.jpg)
And unfortunately for me test was one of the final steps so there is no time for it other than writting some as a proof of that I may heared about testing
